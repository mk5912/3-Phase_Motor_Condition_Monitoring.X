# This Is My University Final Year Project!

## 3-Phase Motor Condition Monitoring System.

### Brief Disclaimer:
Although this code has been uploaded as a "competed" code, it still needs to be tested and improved, and I hereby declared that the code right now can be used as a basis to build upon to produce a fully functioning system.

### Goal of the project:
My goal for this project is to have a functioning and viable product for monitoring the condition of two 3-phase motors used in industrial cooling circuits that allow normal operation of high voltage equipment. I plan to make this come to fruition by designing, building and testing a system that will monitor the drive current, noise, skid vibrations and surface temperatures produced by two motors simultaneously.

### How I plan to achieve this goal:
- I have already started by identifying the components that I will use which are (excluding a few others) as follows;
  1. PIC18F04Q40 microprocessor
  2. Solid state linear current sensor
  3. Condenser microphone
  4. K type thermocouple
  5. Surface mounted accelerometer microchip
- I am now working on the code that will be used to program the system.
- Once the code has been written to a functional level I will be designing a simulated circuit to run and test the code.
- After initial tests and debugging have been completed, I will then be building a physical product to then test and calibrate.

### Terms of use:
This code is open source and available to all who wish to use, modify or merge copies however, due to the lack of sufficien testing and being a project built as a University final year project further distribution is prohibitted. This project is being supplied "as is" and thus if any persons clone this repository for any purposes all liability lies with them and no warraties of any kind will be provided. If anyone who clones this repository encounters an issue please report it under the issues tab, however no claims against the author can be persued.
