# This Is My University Final Year Project!

## 3-Phase Motor Condition Monitoring System.

### Goal of the project:
My goal for this project is to have a functioning and viable product for monitoring the condition of two 3-phase motors used in industrial cooling circuits that allow normal operation of high voltage equipment. I plan to make this come to fruition by designing, building and testing a system that will monitor the drive current, noise, skid vibrations and surface temperatures produced by two motors simultaneously.

### How I plan to achieve this goal:
- I have already started by identifying the components that I will use which are (excluding a few others) as follows;
  1. PIC18F04Q40 microprocessor
  2. Solid state linear current sensor
  3. Condenser microphone
  4. K type thermocouple
  5. Surface mounted accelerometer microchip
- I am now working on the code that will be used to program the system.
- Once the code has been written to a functional level I will be designing a simulated circuit to run and test the code.
- After initial tests and debugging have been completed, I will then be building a physical product to then test and calibrate.
