# This Was My University Final Year Project And Dissertation Topic!

## 3-Phase Motor Condition Monitoring System.

### Brief Disclaimer:
Although this code has been uploaded as a "competed" code, it still needs to be tested and improved, and I hereby declared that the code right now can be used as a basis to build upon to produce a fully functioning system.

### Goal of the project:
My goal for this project was to have a functioning and viable product for monitoring the condition of two 3-phase motors used in industrial cooling circuits that allow normal operation of high voltage equipment. I planned to make this come to fruition by designing, building and testing a system that was to monitor the drive current, noise, skid vibrations and surface temperatures produced by two motors simultaneously.

### How I plan to achieve this goal:
- I have already started by identifying the components that I will use which are (excluding a few others) as follows;
  1. PIC18F13K50 microprocessor
  2. Solid state linear current sensor
  3. Condenser microphone
  4. K type thermocouple
  5. Surface mounted accelerometer microchip
- Although the code for the system is finished in terms of being my university project, I plan to continue working on it until working as a viable product. 
- Once the code has been written to a functional level I will be designing a simulated circuit to run and test the code.
- After I have finished the code in the entirety, I will improve the simmulated circuit changing components as required.
- Once the circuit and code have both been refined and made into a viable product I will work on a computer software to communicate with the device to display and log the sensor value.
- After a suitable HMI software has been produce I will make a physical product to test and fine tune the system.


### Terms of use:
This project is open source and available to all who wish to use, modify or merge copies however, due to the lack of sufficien testing and being a project built as a University final year project further distribution is prohibitted.
